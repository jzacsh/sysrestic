:systemScript: {slocRefBin}/b73710888c23d/share/borgw_system.sh

these are files that facilitate system-wide backup for an encrypted drive. that
is: we assume `/` is {LVMencryption}[encrypted somehow]. Practically this is
just a script and some systemd unit-file to run {sysBackupRsync}[my common
rsync].

== usage & how to

.init `restic` repo
----
$ mkdir /srv/jons-sys-backups
$ restic init --repo /srv/jons-sys-backups/restic
----

NOTE: this is a mish-mosh of {systemScript}[an old system-wide backup] and
{homeScript}[a `$HOME` backup]
